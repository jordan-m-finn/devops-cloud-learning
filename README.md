# DevOps & Cloud Engineering Learning Repo 🚀

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to my **DevOps & Cloud Engineering** learning repository! This repo tracks my progress as I develop skills in **Linux, AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and Cloud Security** in preparation for a DevOps internship.

## 🏆 Goals
- Gain **hands-on experience** with cloud infrastructure.
- Build **automation scripts** using Python & Bash.
- Deploy applications using **Terraform & Kubernetes**.
- Set up **CI/CD pipelines** to automate deployments.
- Learn **monitoring & logging** for cloud services.

## 📂 Repo Structure
```
📂 linux-bash/          # Bash scripts for automation
📂 aws-python/          # Python scripts interacting with AWS
📂 terraform-projects/  # Terraform IaC files
📂 ci-cd-pipelines/     # CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)
📂 kubernetes/          # Kubernetes YAML files
📂 monitoring-logging/  # CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana configurations
```

## 📅 Learning Roadmap
### **🟢 Phase 1: Core Skills (Feb - June 2025)**

- ✅ AWS Basics (EC2, S3, IAM, Lambda)
- ✅ Python automation scripts for AWS
- ✅ Terraform basics & first AWS deployment

### **🟡 Phase 2: DevOps Tools & Deployment (July - Oct 2025)**
- ⏳ Deploy a microservices app with **Kubernetes**
- ⏳ Set up **CI/CD pipelines** for automated deployments
- ⏳ Monitor cloud resources using **AWS CloudWatch & Prometheus**

### **🟠 Phase 3: Internship Prep (Nov 2025 - Feb 2026)**
- ⏳ Work on final **DevOps portfolio project**
- ⏳ Obtain **AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate**
- ⏳ Apply for **Summer 2026 DevOps internships**

## 🛠️ Projects
| 📂 Project | 📝 Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **AWS Auto-Scaling** | Python script to auto-scale EC2 instances based on CPU usage |
| **Terraform Deployment** | IaC deployment for a web app using AWS Terraform modules |
| **GitHub Actions Pipeline** | CI/CD pipeline for automated AWS Lambda deployments |
| **Kubernetes App** | Deploy a containerized app using Kubernetes |

## 📌 Next Steps
- Start with **Linux, Bash, & AWS basics** (`linux-bash/`, `aws-python/`).
- Commit my first **Terraform configuration** (`terraform-projects/`).
- Document my progress in this repo!
